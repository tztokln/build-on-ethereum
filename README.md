Congratulations! You have created your first NFT.

Now that you know how to do it, if you want to practice a little more, I recommend the following:

install IPFS desktop client
upload a few pictures to it
copy the CIDs from the IPFS desktop client, and prefix them with “ipfs://” to get the IPFS links
create a few more NFTs using those links
